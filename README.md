## Project Description

Futaba is a new interoperability solution that is specialized in data acquisition. Data from other chains can be used cheaply and quickly.

## Problem 

Sending data is good, but getting data has many cons. In fact, when getting data from other chains multiple transactions are required each time, which involves
high gas fees, transactions timed consumed and unoptimized transactions. 

## Solution
